I'm a second-year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science and Philosophy.

I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI), as well as product management (PM) in general. 

Previously, I interned with Microsoft at M365 Core under The New Technologist program.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and powerlifting. I like learning computer science theory and (sometimes) philosophy and love [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL7xO92hRDI), video games, and [movies](https://letterboxd.com/juliusdcreator/) in my free time.
