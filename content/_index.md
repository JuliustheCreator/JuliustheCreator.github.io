I'm a second-year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science and Philosophy.

I'm deeply interested in the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). My focus lies at the intersection of AI alignment, ethics, and machine learning. I believe that AI has the potential to significantly advance humanity, provided we navigate its development with caution.

I was a New Technologist intern at Microsoft under M365 Core; I gained experience in both product management and software engineering.

I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and powerlifting, like learning computer science theory and (sometimes) philosophy, and love [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqhkqnSg164&ab_channel=Stereolab-Topic), [video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5fpTvdExsY&ab_channel=Zygart), and [movies](https://letterboxd.com/juliusdcreator/) in my free time.
