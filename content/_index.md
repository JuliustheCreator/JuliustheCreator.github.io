I'm a third year undergrad at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science, Math, and Philosophy (the last two are minors), with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation.

My current interests include topics in artificial intelligence and value alignment, multi-agent and complex systems, algorithmic bias and fairness, game theory, and computational social science.

In my free time, I like listening to [music](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/shares/66e2590579338f0c0391913f) (a lot), [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/juliusdcreator) (not that good), games outside of chess, staying relatively active, and studying philosophy (sometimes).
