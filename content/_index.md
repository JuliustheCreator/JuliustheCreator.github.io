I'm a second-year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science and Philosophy.

I'm interested in AI and HCI, specifically AI alignment, Explainable AI (XAI), and machine learning.

This summer, I was a SWE & PM intern at Microsoft as a New Technologist intern

I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and powerlifting, like learning computer science theory and (sometimes) philosophy, and love [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqhkqnSg164&ab_channel=Stereolab-Topic), [video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5fpTvdExsY&ab_channel=Zygart), and [movies](https://letterboxd.com/juliusdcreator/) in my free time.
