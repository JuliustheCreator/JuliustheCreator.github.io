I'm Julius, a third year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science, Math, and Philosophy (the last two are my minors), with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation.

I'm mostly interested in...

&nbsp;&nbsp;**AI Safety:** Algorithmic Bias and Fairness; Adversarial Robustness; AI Alignment (Near-term Safety Challenges); Safety-Capability Balance

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Multi-Agent Systems** _(very broadly)_ **:** Agent-Based Simulations; Recommendation; Game Theory; Reinforcement Learning; Red Teaming; Human-AI Interaction

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Computational Social Science:** Computational Sociology; Social Media; Information Diffusion; Social Network Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;**AI + Philosophy of X:** Political Theory, Social Theory, Race, Existential Theory, Ethics, Science

In my free time, I like listening to [music](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/shares/66e2590579338f0c0391913f) (a lot), [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/juliusdcreator), games outside of chess, staying somewhat active, and studying [philosophy]() (sometimes).
