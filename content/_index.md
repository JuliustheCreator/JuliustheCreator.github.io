I'm a second-year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science, Math, and Philosophy, with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation.

I'm mostly interested in AI, specifically AI alignment research. Outside of AI, I like learning about computer science theory and (sometimes) philosophy.

Previously, I've worked at Microsoft.
