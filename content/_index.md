I'm a second-year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science, Math, and Philosophy, with CS concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation.

I'm mostly interested in AI, specifically AI safety. Outside of AI, I like learning about game theory, music, computer science theory, and (sometimes) philosophy.

Currently, I'm doing AI alignment research through the Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR). Previously, I've worked at Microsoft.
