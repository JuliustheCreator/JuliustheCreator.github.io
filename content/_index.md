I'm Julius, a third year student at Georgia Tech, where I'm studying Computer Science, Math, and Philosophy (the last two are my minors), with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation.

I'm mostly interested in...

- **AI Safety:** Algorithmic Bias and Fairness; Adversarial Robustness; Value Alignment; Safety-Capability Balance

- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Agent-Based Simulations; Recommendation; Game Theoretic Approaches; Reinforcement Learning

- **Computational Social Science:** Computational Sociology; Social Media; Information Diffusion; Social Network Analysis

- **AI + Philosophy:** Postmodernism; Critical Theory; Critical Data Studies; Philosophy of Ethics, Science; Existentialism

In my free time, I like listening to [music](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/shares/66e2590579338f0c0391913f) (a lot), [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/juliusdcreator), games outside of chess, staying somewhat active, and studying [philosophy]() (sometimes).
